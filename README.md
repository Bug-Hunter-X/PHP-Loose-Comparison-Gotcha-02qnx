This example demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose comparison.  The function `foo` uses loose comparison (`==`), which compares values without considering their type.  The function `bar` shows how this can lead to unexpected results when comparing a number and a string that represent the same numerical value.  The solution demonstrates the importance of using strict comparison (`===`) to avoid such pitfalls.
